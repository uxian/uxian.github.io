&lt;p&gt;After finishing &lt;em&gt;The Untethered Soul&lt;/em&gt;, I bought &lt;em&gt;The Surrender Experiment&lt;/em&gt;. But it sat on my bookshelf for several years, because I already knew it would talk about how to surrender to reality and the flow of life, how the author step by step became the head of a publicly listed company—-success coming so easily. I wasn’t very keen on reading a memoir that felt full of superiority and survivor bias. But one day, with nothing else to do, I picked it up, and from the first chapter, I resonated deeply. This was my feeling too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The universe has existed for 13.8 billion years. Amid the desolate cosmos, a bunch of loose particles were running around, and somehow human beings and consciousness came into being—-so marvelous and intricate. We tend to think that our own consciousness is crucially important, but whether it’s moving a finger or running a company, these aren’t achievements of our slow, feeble consciousness alone. Everything is a product of chance and circumstance. Whether we accept it or not, the universe always flows through us, merging us into its current.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book differs from &lt;em&gt;The Untethered Soul&lt;/em&gt; in that it includes many of the author’s personal stories, helping readers better understand meditation, mindfulness, acceptance, spiritual practice, and surrender, and their relevance and meaning in daily life. I really like how the author’s story begins with a single thought: he became aware of that constantly chattering voice in his mind. He had no particular worries; he wasn’t suffering. He just noticed the voice. And so began his lifelong quest-—first trying to eliminate the voice through meditation, then traveling in search of answers, then returning to build a small cabin for solitary living, and apprenticing under a yoga master. Gradually, he discovered that he needed to accept that voice, accept other people’s requests and arrangements, and officially begin what he called “The Surrender Experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further on, I couldn’t help thinking: the author must be incredibly talented; his dad works in finance, and he could easily have become an economics professor. It wouldn’t have surprised anyone if he eventually succeeded—-it’s not necessarily about whether he surrendered. Let’s be honest: we often care about whether someone “deserves” their success. To mitigate our own mediocrity, we classify successful people as heirs to wealth, unscrupulous opportunists, or simply lucky. But even that starting point is problematic—-why be so fixated on your own or others’ success? Indeed, that’s just another voice in our head, and there’s no need to identify with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author’s story is actually quite wonderful and aligns with the laws of nature. It slowly takes root and grows; through meditation, he met many people, gradually forming an organization, and started a company. Then, guided by his interests, he began one of the earliest careers as a coder. It’s not a tale of overnight riches. It’s not about sleepless nights of grinding, nor about using every trick in the book. It’s about meditating morning and night, working earnestly, and living each day well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book gave me a lot of energy. When needed, I’ll recognize that voice in my mind, accept it, and let it go. When someone offers me suggestions, I’ll listen carefully, accept, and take action. I’ll do what I want to do, and also help people around me as much as I can, because I can accept any outcome—-there’s no need for special expectations or fears. I believe the universal current created me and everything I have, and it will most likely continue creating the future as well. In fact, I am the universe.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">While reading this book, it gave me energy.</summary></entry><entry xml:lang="en"><title type="html">Attention Is All You Need</title><link href="https://junbo.li/2024/11/11/attention.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Attention Is All You Need" /><published>2024-11-11T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2024-11-11T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://junbo.li/2024/11/11/attention</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://junbo.li/2024/11/11/attention.html">&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 20px&quot;&gt;

&lt;meta property=&quot;og:image&quot; content=&quot;https://junbo.li/assets/2024-11-11-attention/attention.jpg&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you own something but never think of it, you don’t really own it. Until you remember it and use it, you don’t truly possess it. In reality, you don’t truly own anything; you only own your attention. You can indeed buy something and place it somewhere, allowing only yourself or those you permit to use it. Legally, you own it, but even during its use, all you gain is your attention and the meaning you project onto it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t need so many things, especially expensive ones. We often want to buy nice things, thinking they will bring us great happiness, completely ignoring the problems they bring: reduced savings, increasing financial pressure, a cluttered home, more effort needed for cleaning, and perhaps the need to buy more complementary items. At the moment of purchase, we are happy, maybe for a few days, but soon we forget about it, take it for granted, and inexplicably add some psychological burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can realize that all your desires are merely attention, then you actually have everything from the start. You own the most expensive mansion by watching videos; you can learn about many luxurious homes around the world, and you can visit the Louvre or other palaces that even the wealthiest cannot buy. You own the most expensive cars by attending car shows where you can see the most exquisite and coolest sports cars. You can view all expensive spectacles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there really a difference between owning and visiting? Perhaps when you don’t actually own something, you experience more feelings, a slight joy of getting closer, a passion for pursuit, a feast of attention. On the contrary, after owning, you might quickly lose interest. Moreover, what you get after truly owning something may not match your imagination, with both good and bad aspects, but certainly not enough to fulfill your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does not getting what you seek cause you pain? You can constantly remind yourself that you already have everything. Whatever you notice, you own. Simply moving an item from a store to your home doesn’t make it better; admiring and touching it at home isn’t more wonderful than doing the same in the store. The extra you gain from purchasing it isn’t as much as you imagine, only the urgency to prove spending so much money was worth it, and the reasons you reluctantly find, or the recognition of some selling points that merchants rack their brains to come up with. Humans have an obsessive understanding of degrees; people are amazed that Bolt can run 9.58 seconds, 0.16 seconds faster than the second-place sprinter at 9.74 seconds! But is there really such a big difference, a 1.6% difference, when an ostrich runs twice as fast? Is buying something really much happier than occasionally admiring it in a store, by 1.6%? We can completely immerse ourselves in this 1.6% of wonderful feeling as society tells us, but if you think it’s nothing, and eating an orange makes you happier, then you can completely spend $1.6 or less to eat an orange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have enough money to buy something without any burden, then buy it, to keep this beautiful thing for humanity and contribute a little to economic prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article seems a bit clickbait, borrowing the title of an epic paper in the AI field, but the world is full of fascinating fractals, and the dominant role of attention is applicable in all dimensions. Attention, or the mechanism of filtering, selecting, screening, and refining, is the core of all complex systems, including consciousness and psychological mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry xml:lang="en"><title type="html">A Small Awakening - Freedom is Nature</title><link href="https://junbo.li/2024/11/07/freedom-nature.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Small Awakening - Freedom is Nature" /><published>2024-11-07T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2024-11-07T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://junbo.li/2024/11/07/freedom-nature</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://junbo.li/2024/11/07/freedom-nature.html">&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 20px&quot;&gt;

&lt;meta property=&quot;og:image&quot; content=&quot;https://junbo.li/assets/2024-11-07-freedom-nature/freedom-is-nature.jpg&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;excessive-blame-and-pressure-bring-unfreedom&quot;&gt;Excessive Blame and Pressure Bring Unfreedom&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freedom is actually nature—it moves of its own accord; in other words, it’s natural for oneself to act this way, which is nature. We always think we need to strive to do something, strive to avoid mistakes, strive to meet others’ or our own expectations—over-blaming, over-pressuring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, once we’ve made a mistake, people naturally want to avoid making the same mistake in the future. We over-blame ourselves, perhaps because when we were young and did something wrong, our parents would scold or punish us a bit, believing that if they didn’t, the child might make bigger mistakes in the future. The child internalizes this mentality of over-blaming, and when grown up, over-blames themselves in everything. But actually, many times, it’s unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People always compare themselves with those around them. If they feel inferior now, they want to catch up or even surpass others in the future. Even if this path doesn’t work, they’ll switch paths to surpass. So they set very high expectations for themselves, force themselves to do many things, creating a lot of unnecessary pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to distinguish between striving and forcing; the former comes from the heart, the latter is imposed. When we are willing to put in effort and enjoy the process, we will inevitably achieve the results we deserve and feel more fulfilled and worthy. But when we force ourselves to do many things and don’t enjoy the process, we may occasionally achieve good results, but afterward, we may feel somewhat lost, not meeting expectations, feeling it’s a fluke, somewhat empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;when-walking-just-walk&quot;&gt;When Walking, Just Walk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple example: if we think we should take a walk in the morning while the sun is out to increase serotonin, benefit our energy for the whole day, and help us sleep well at night. With such ulterior motives, we might still think about work or worries during the walk, or be anxious that walking takes too much time. After walking, we might not feel physically and mentally relaxed, and may even feel disappointed that the leisurely walking time ended so quickly, even resisting the work that follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if we can fully enjoy the process of walking—observe the flowers and plants around us, bask in the sunlight, introspect the thoughts that pop up at any time without agreeing or following them, letting them come and go as they please, greet people who meet our eyes—if we can truly enjoy walking without expecting to gain anything from it, then we get the walk itself and all the genuine benefits that walking can bring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I had similar thoughts before, truly achieving it and experiencing it is not easy. The turning point lies in whether we have transcended our attachment to the self. It’s not that I want to fully enjoy walking, but that the “Tao” (or “Reality”) goes through the entire process. I do not presumptuously try to interfere with the process; interference is actually an illusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-best-state-of-consciousness-is-not-to-obstruct-the-tao&quot;&gt;The Best State of Consciousness Is Not to Obstruct the “Tao”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consciousness is the observer. Its best state is not to obstruct, allowing the “Tao” (“Reality,” “Energy”) to flow freely. Consciousness is most important because all beings and things have meaning because they are observed. It is light, making the places it illuminates vibrant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the subconscious in the brain that thinks, and the body that acts. Consciousness can choose to observe thoughts, bodily signals, or the environment. When we are anxious about the past or future, consciousness only illuminates tangled thoughts, leaving no time to pay attention to surroundings or actions, so the whole person gets stuck and stagnates. But most of the time, our consciousness is not completely blocked by anxiety; we spend 80% of the time thinking and acting, and 20% resisting unsatisfactory things and extra actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we can achieve non-resistance, everything will flow smoothly through us; we observe those delightful moments and details, we let the universe and ourselves play freely, and we attain ultimate happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-i-within-the-tao&quot;&gt;The “I” Within the “Tao”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We always think that value should be created by the “I,” but who created the “I” and allows me to perform? Don’t forget, before there were people, it was the universe that gave birth to humans. The insignificance of “I” as an individual lies in the fact that my behavior patterns are shaped by human traditions; I rely on the natural and social environment for survival; I need others to help me accomplish almost everything (food, computers, internet, colleagues, etc.). In the vast universe and society, “I” as an individual is almost untraceable. But “I as an individual” is an illusion; “I” have no way, and no need, to separate from this universe; “I” and the entire universe in which I live are one whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;consciousness-is-a-state-of-maintenance-possessing-infinity&quot;&gt;Consciousness Is a State of Maintenance, Possessing Infinity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone’s body is ordinary; what everyone owns is also ordinary. But each person has their own consciousness, which is the highest existence in this universe. Each independent consciousness reflects the entire universe; others’ bodies and joys can be observed by any consciousness. If the body is one with the entire universe, what about consciousness? The unique subjective experience is unique to each conscious entity, right? Yes and no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because consciousness is also an illusion—it is a continuous observation; the observer cannot be aware of itself; the process of observation generates the illusion of observing. To paraphrase Descartes: “I observe, therefore I am.” Essentially, from matter to consciousness, all is movement, change, process. Existence is a state of maintenance, the same movement repeating continuously. Detached from the observed object, or without observing, the “observer” does not exist; when we sleep, consciousness disappears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we say that each consciousness’s process of observation is independent and unique, but actually, what we observe, as well as the neural network structures of all observers, are one whole. Although consciousness has its uniqueness, conscious entities can resonate; humans have a collective unconscious. Although it’s not that I can remotely view or sense others’ consciousness, there’s actually not much difference; our subjective consciousness is largely the same. It seems we don’t need to transcend consciousness, because there is nothing beyond consciousness; consciousness is contained within all beings; beings are infinite; the universe is infinite; therefore, consciousness is infinite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;return-to-the-present-let-the-power-of-the-universe-flow-through-you&quot;&gt;Return to the Present, Let the Power of the Universe Flow Through You&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, let go of all regrets, anxieties, and ambitions. Do not force; fully experience the present; do not obstruct others’ or your own thoughts and actions. “Do nothing, and nothing is left undone.” Let the power of the universe flow through you—it has created the brilliant human civilization and will create even more incredible miracles.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry xml:lang="en"><title type="html">Review of ‘The Talented Mr. Ripley’</title><link href="https://junbo.li/2024/01/08/talented-ripley.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Review of ‘The Talented Mr. Ripley’" /><published>2024-01-08T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2024-01-08T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://junbo.li/2024/01/08/talented-ripley</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://junbo.li/2024/01/08/talented-ripley.html">&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 20px&quot;&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;romantic-aura&quot;&gt;Romantic Aura&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first half of the film effortlessly creates a romantic atmosphere through close-ups of the actors, the charming scenery of the Italian seaside, old villas, and a somewhat vintage look. It makes you feel as if you are right there, experiencing the humid air by the sea and gazing into the eyes of the charming protagonists, wrapped in a naturally soothing romance. It’s been a long time since I felt this way while watching a movie. Not all directors and actors can be so restrained, appropriate, and immersive when portraying romance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;beauty&quot;&gt;Beauty&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the movie, another takeaway for me is that my understanding of beauty has become gradually clearer. Beauty is not an objective phenomenon; it is a subjective feeling, merely a sensation. Our bodies can perceive beauty, but our brains always need to abstract some concepts to try to capture the essence of beauty and understand its patterns through the process of creating beauty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We perceive beauty through various stimuli and sensations, such as accelerated heartbeat, increased adrenaline, dopamine secretion, ecstasy, subconsciously holding our breath, tears, and the desire to take photos. There are so many sources and ways to experience beauty. Why do we all call it beauty? Is there something common among them? One way to answer this question is to see if we can create beauty, and creating and discovering beauty is the same process. It is about creating opportunities and observing the complete process from cause to effect. We try various paths to beauty through painting, architecture, sculpture, music, and industrial design. From some good examples like this movie, Van Gogh and Picasso’s paintings, and Apple’s product design, I can see some conceptual elements of beauty: full of details, clear priorities, good quality, and harmony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although following these principles can produce beautiful products that people want to buy and sell at a good price, these abstract concepts do not directly correspond to our body’s various sensations. Our bodies cannot directly perceive “harmony.” So, what exactly is beauty? Is it meaningful to pursue a deeper understanding of this concept? I believe in and enjoy infinite details and diversity, but I also believe there are some deeper essences and foundations, which is consciousness. I think consciousness is the electrical activity of the brain, and other parts of the body support the brain. Subjective feelings are feedback signals from various organs of the body. Beauty is those positive signals that better support brain activity, body survival, and reproduction. Things that generate these signals are beautiful, but the concept of beauty is further expanded by interpersonal and social culture, perhaps extending to things that promote groups and beliefs. The beauty principles mentioned earlier are traceable in this chain: details in the jungle are key to life and death, clear priorities are the brain’s main task, good quality items are more reliable hunting tools, and harmony is order, habit, and efficiency. Beauty is first and foremost good and positive, but when we consider empathy and comfort for sad emotions as good, then tragic beauty is established. “Tragic” and “beauty” can be different aspects of the same specific event, independent yet coincidentally occurring together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, beauty is not the most core thing. In my opinion, many people, including the protagonists of this movie, place the feeling of being loved and charm, which is a sense of beauty, as the top priority, living in a castle in the air, gradually falling into extremes and abyss. Overall, beauty is not an ethereal thing; it is directly rooted in our survival foundation. Our perception and pursuit of beauty follow the way of life. Although beauty is not the most core thing, existence and development are, beauty is the catalyst of life, the salt of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;love&quot;&gt;Love&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love is the theme of this movie. Love can take many forms and cover a wide range, but there is a feeling often mistaken for or disguised as love that I think needs to be distinguished, which is possessiveness. I even believe that simply liking a person or thing is not love; it is a derivative emotion of love. Many people have said, and I partly agree, that love is more of a verb. Returning to my previous description of consciousness, beauty is those positive signals, and love is the source of those signals. These behaviors generate neural stimuli that are the feeling of love and are also beautiful. When we find something beneficial to us, we feel fond of it and want to get more love. The key point is the initial act of love, not the desire to get more. Fondness and desire are by-products, very meaningful, forming a positive feedback loop, but pursuing these so-called love, actually desires, is like chasing a mirage, putting the cart before the horse. Love is the act of treating oneself or others well. The subject of love is the person who performs the act, and the object of love is the person being treated well. Therefore, one can love oneself and then have self-respect; one can also love others, and others will receive love. The other person may or may not love back, but once there is love, the overall sense of happiness always increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it is hard to distinguish between inferiority and narcissism. I even think they are the same thing, only seeing oneself, without self-love, living on others’ love, and constantly demanding. Tom in the movie shows obvious inferiority, repeatedly replaying in his mind Dickie and the female lead saying “I like him,” and losing his mind when Dickie calls him boring. In fact, Dickie is not necessarily an extremely boring person, and it could be laughed off without taking it seriously. Narcissistic people care most about others’ evaluations. Dickie is another extreme manifestation of the same narcissistic personality, being cynical, flirtatious, rebellious, and prodigal. Perhaps it is due to being spoiled from a young age and not receiving a bit of love from a busy, stern father, leading to a loss of deep life meaning and motivation, not establishing self-love and independence, living a glamorous but worthless, even harmful life to society, relying on family money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my view, love is an action, and action is the main content of life. Seeing, caring for, treating oneself and those around kindly, and being grateful, there is no need to fall into the abyss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Talented Mr. Ripley” is a great movie, with plot and details worth pondering, the actors’ performances are delightful, and it serves as a good reminder.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry xml:lang="en"><title type="html">Summary of OpenAI 2023 DevDay</title><link href="https://junbo.li/2023/11/07/openai-dev-day.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Summary of OpenAI 2023 DevDay" /><published>2023-11-07T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-11-07T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://junbo.li/2023/11/07/openai-dev-day</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://junbo.li/2023/11/07/openai-dev-day.html">&lt;p&gt;On Monday, November 6th, during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/new-models-and-developer-products-announced-at-devday&quot;&gt;Open AI DevDay&lt;/a&gt;, ChatGPT received a major update, with its knowledge base finally updated to April of this year, showing great sincerity. Additionally, the GPT Store was announced, extending an olive branch to creators, inviting them to earn together. Here is my summary of the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;meta property=&quot;og:image&quot; content=&quot;https://junbo.li/assets/2023-11-07-openai-dev-day/gpts.png&quot; /&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 20px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2023-11-07-openai-dev-day/gpts.png&quot; class=&quot;centered-image&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gpt-4-turbo-released&quot;&gt;GPT-4 Turbo Released&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The knowledge base has been updated from September 2021 to April 2023, and future updates will be faster. Finally!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The context token limit has been upgraded from 8K/32K to 128K, roughly the length of a 300-page book, even surpassing Claude 2’s 100K.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Output speed has doubled.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Users no longer need to choose which plugin to activate; the model will automatically select the appropriate plugin, such as DALL-E, web browsing, or data analysis, when needed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ChatGPT Plus will immediately switch to GPT-4 Turbo.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Multimodal capabilities were briefly mentioned, which are certainly impressive, but since GPT-4V was released two months ago, it’s not new information.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;API prices have dropped: input token prices decreased threefold to $0.01/1K, and output token prices halved to $0.03/1K. So, using the maximum 128K context would cost $1.28. Writing a 300-page book would cost $3.84.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Function calling can now handle multiple functions simultaneously.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Parameters can be set to increase the determinism of results with the same input.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;By the end of the year, GPT-4 Turbo’s multimodal capabilities will be available.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;GPT-3.5 also received a price cut, with input token prices reduced by 75% to $0.003/1K and output token prices decreased by 62% to $0.006/1K.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Large enterprises can also perform fine-tuning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;custom-gpts-and-gpt-store&quot;&gt;Custom GPTs and GPT Store&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is definitely a major event in the AI world! It will have a more profound impact than the incremental update of GPT-4 Turbo.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ordinary users can easily create custom GPTs, which can be done in just a few minutes. You can set its name, functions, upload data files as a dedicated knowledge base, and even integrate some APIs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Placing custom GPTs in the GPT Store allows for revenue sharing. This might truly be the App Store Moment. I’m anxious, not wanting to miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, but I don’t have any good ideas yet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The conference showcased GPTs from several companies, such as Code.org for programming education and CanvaGPT for graphic design, all using ChatGPT’s chat interface but deeply integrated with these companies’ services.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It also demonstrated how to use Zapier AI Actions to manage your calendar, texts, etc. What does this mean? In the future, you can let ChatGPT access your email, Notion, and more, just by talking to ChatGPT to get things done and check your recorded information.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sam Altman personally demonstrated how to create a simple GPT without needing to write code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assistants-api&quot;&gt;Assistants API&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is mainly aimed at application developers to simplify the integration of apps with OpenAI.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The custom GPTs mentioned above have interfaces on the ChatGPT website. The Assistants API, however, is designed to help other products or apps integrate ChatGPT, with the interface being the app’s own.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Previously, integrating ChatGPT involved simply calling an API, which was stateless, requiring all context to be input each time. For chat functions, this meant transmitting the entire conversation content with each API call, which was not only slow but also expensive. Developers had to manage state, prompt and context management, extend capabilities, and retrieval themselves. Now, with the threading feature, it is a stateful API, where only the latest information needs to be sent in the same session. It also provides retrieval and a code interpreter.&lt;/li&gt;

It’s not only full of energy but also packed with valuable information. I force myself to write down my insights and further thoughts to avoid forgetting them after watching, thus wasting time. After watching these videos, my overall feeling is that I’m no longer confused by many phenomena in the economy. I put the takeaways from each episode at the end, and below are some of my own thoughts combined with my previous reflections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;money-and-finance&quot;&gt;Money and Finance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The core of money&lt;/strong&gt; is that it is something that can easily exchange products and services. Complex finance and economics revolve around this core. Money no longer needs gold to back it, so what backs the value of money? It’s credit; people trust that the state can stabilize prices and ensure that money can steadily exchange products and services. In ancient times, gold and silver were used for transactions because of their reliability and scarcity; they wouldn’t spoil, and no one could create gold and silver out of thin air to dilute their value. In modern times, why isn’t cryptocurrency a good form of money? Although it’s reliable, its quantity is almost fixed, and as productivity increases, it doesn’t increase correspondingly, so its value will keep rising. This means that people holding cryptocurrency can earn money without doing anything, which doesn’t promote but rather hinders economic development. Cryptocurrency can be a luxury, like diamonds, for personal satisfaction, but it cannot replace money. The cost of currency should indeed be as low as possible to free up productivity for more meaningful products and services. In this regard, the production costs of gold, silver, and cryptocurrency are too high. Therefore, &lt;strong&gt;money is the credit of the state, reflecting the total products and services of society&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead of racking your brains to make money, chasing shadows, or even going astray, it’s better to think about how to produce more and better products and services. If they are good enough, someone will be willing to spend money on your products and services. For example, following Buffett’s value investing means giving funds to more valuable companies, allowing them to develop and produce better products and services, and sharing their achievements, which is meaningful. On the other hand, engaging in quantitative trading, or even manipulating the market to try to make money from the stock market, is meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The significance of the financial system&lt;/strong&gt; is to lend and invest money to those who can produce more products and services, increasing the total amount of quality products and services, and then meeting demand through transactions. &lt;strong&gt;The financial system is a screening mechanism&lt;/strong&gt;. The core of creating value is to increase social productivity, which is true progress for individuals and society. Each of us might as well aim to improve global GDP, seeking the best and achieving the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Money and finance are based on demand&lt;/strong&gt;. Every person, from birth to death, has a lot of needs, and &lt;strong&gt;humans are the only demand side&lt;/strong&gt;. Without people, there is no demand. If more people are born in a period, or supply cannot keep up, then each person in that generation will face greater scarcity and competition at every stage of life, and unmet needs will intensify competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do individuals get money to meet their needs&lt;/strong&gt;? How does the central bank print money and give it to individuals? The central bank issues currency out of thin air, lends it to the state and banks, or uses it to buy assets to raise their prices. The state can directly give money to individuals, but this is rare; investment institutions and individuals obtain new money by selling appreciated assets for reproduction or consumption, increasing circulation; individuals participate in product production and services, receiving increased wages from companies. Every time money is used, it meets a need, and every additional 100 yuan serves an actual effect of 500-1000. These various ways subsidize new goods and services, stabilizing prices. If a person does not produce or invest, the state and central bank can hardly give money to him, only providing minimal support. So generally speaking, new money is still transmitted through the purchase of products, services, and loans. &lt;strong&gt;The main way to get money in this economic chain is to produce and sell products and services&lt;/strong&gt;, a very boring yet simple conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-intervention-of-artificial-intelligence&quot;&gt;The Intervention of Artificial Intelligence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if there are no jobs&lt;/strong&gt;? If artificial intelligence replaces a large number of jobs in the future, companies and individuals using artificial intelligence will significantly increase productivity. The state needs to issue more currency to subsidize new products and services. In the current way, these unemployed people cannot obtain new currency, leading to a widening wealth gap, reduced consumption, and deflation. The state may directly pay everyone wages to forcibly stimulate demand and narrow the wealth gap, but this is equivalent to robbing the rich to help the poor, which is not conducive to further productivity improvement and will lead to a weakening welfare society like Europe. Given the current competition and tension between countries, no one wants to show weakness. More tricky is that artificial intelligence will inevitably reach or even surpass human capabilities, taking on almost all known jobs. Without seeking to turn back history, the important thing is how we smoothly transition through this period and ultimately coexist harmoniously with artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One entry point is that &lt;strong&gt;humans have needs, while artificial intelligence seems to have none&lt;/strong&gt;. They don’t need to consider food and various psychological needs, nor do they have the concept of life and death. An artificial intelligence without desires cannot replace the demand side of human economic activities, at least for now. Of course, artificial intelligence may also develop various emotions and needs, which would require effort to reconcile. So, an optimal solution is that, broadly speaking, humans act as the demand side, and artificial intelligence acts as the production side. The driving force for artificial intelligence is to produce better products and services to meet more people’s needs (this sounds like the relationship between “gods” and people in ancient Egypt, or nobles and slaves in feudal times -_-). When material needs are greatly satisfied, people will shift from pursuing money to more self-pursuits, knowledge, companionship, and recognition, aiming for the stars and the sea. It sounds beautiful, but how can these things be exchanged for living supplies? The communal pot approach is unlikely to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More likely, the culture of &lt;strong&gt;competition and cooperation&lt;/strong&gt; among humans will continue. Those who own artificial intelligence will gain a greater competitive advantage, and people will flock to it. Gradually, artificial intelligence will be written into elementary school textbooks, and people will get used to using artificial intelligence just like they are used to computers and mobile phones, living a life of working for money and enjoying life after work. Competition may become more intense in the next twenty to thirty years, with a new wave of unemployment similar to the previous wave of worker layoffs, and new jobs will emerge. Human generational replacement will be accompanied by pain and excitement, developing forward in a curved path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;complexity&quot;&gt;Complexity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were to describe the story of Earth with the simplest model, I would say it is the &lt;strong&gt;continuous increase in complexity&lt;/strong&gt;. Inorganic matter → single cells → multicellular organisms → plants → animals → communities → humans → clans → beliefs → nations → societies → financial systems → the internet → weak artificial intelligence → strong artificial intelligence → AGI → AGI robots → AGI society → multi-planet civilization. Complexity is a large accumulation of simplicity; many neural units build perception and wisdom, many people build society and nations, many simple transactions form the financial system, and many computers and network cables build the internet. The accumulation of complexity rises exponentially under conditions without enough constraints. The human brain is limited and cannot expand freely, so its understanding ability is limited, while artificial intelligence can expand freely, maintaining its exponential rise. Artificial intelligence is no longer like traditional computers that simply perform parallel calculations but fully replaces all functions of the human brain. &lt;strong&gt;So humans will eventually be outpaced by AGI’s intelligence&lt;/strong&gt;. Even now, human decisions are based on partial information, intuition, or mood. The brain cannot hold too many factors and the complex relationships between them, so it keeps simplifying, and &lt;strong&gt;the more simplified, the more distorted&lt;/strong&gt;. Not to mention AGI, even ChatGPT now provides very comprehensive and unbiased answers. So, in the case of known information, AGI will definitely make better decisions than humans. But AGI is not a god; the complexity of this world also lies in the fact that no one can grasp all the information. Just like every economic crisis, people speak eloquently, but in fact, no one knows what will happen. Some rules can be summarized, but &lt;strong&gt;unknown factors far exceed known factors&lt;/strong&gt;, such as the sudden pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the Israel-Palestine war. In the end, it’s all just speculation. The rise in complexity not only promotes progress but &lt;strong&gt;is also a background and requirement&lt;/strong&gt;, constantly increasing the difficulty of challenges for participants. Those who cannot adapt will eventually lose their competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;takeaways-from-each-episode&quot;&gt;Takeaways from Each Episode&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;microsofts-acquisition-of-activision-blizzard&quot;&gt;Microsoft’s Acquisition of Activision Blizzard&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the acquisition, Microsoft’s market share in the gaming industry ranks third after Tencent and Sony; Sony tried every means to obstruct the acquisition, and it took nearly two years to succeed; the core controversy hindering the acquisition was whether Microsoft would monopolize “Call of Duty.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;evergrande&quot;&gt;Evergrande&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evergrande played the leverage game, borrowing money crazily to buy land and build houses. Eventually, due to strengthened regulations and tightened liquidity, the capital chain broke, leading to bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;israeli-economy&quot;&gt;Israeli Economy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel’s economy relies on aid from the United States and Germany, and with a wealth of talent, it can innovate in technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-biggest-stock-market-flash-crash-caused-in-a-bedroom&quot;&gt;The Biggest Stock Market “Flash Crash” Caused in a Bedroom&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to think that market fluctuations were due to objective reasons or actions by big players. But this story tells us that a teenager at home can manipulate the stock market by placing a large number of fake stock orders (e.g., buy orders below market price that won’t actually be executed but create false demand), raising stock prices and profiting from it. He placed 20% of the total stock market orders that day, causing a flash crash, and it took five years to discover. This kind of arbitrage is illegal, and the young man cooperated with regulators to expose similar illegal activities by big investment banks. It makes one think that the stock market is full of such random events, making it hard to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;real-estate-economics&quot;&gt;Real Estate Economics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Houses are a necessity and an investment, requiring loans (credit). Real estate connects to the financial system through loans. If house prices fall, leading to increased defaults, banks will suffer losses, tighten mortgages, reduce liquidity, decrease economic activity, and lower overall demand, causing a recession. &lt;strong&gt;35 out of the last 50 economic crises were triggered by real estate bubbles bursting.&lt;/strong&gt; The wealth effect of real estate is very different from other assets (stocks). If stocks appreciate, people’s consumption increases, but if real estate appreciates, homeowners won’t necessarily increase consumption, while potential buyers will save more to afford a house in the future. If house prices fall, everyone tightens their belts, and a sharp drop in house prices can easily trigger a recession. Factors affecting house prices: population, economy, interest rates, policies; the supply cycle of houses is long, limited by labor and resources, so its impact is generally less than the demand side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;banking-rules&quot;&gt;Banking Rules&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic business of banks is cash deposits and withdrawals. Due to their lending ability, they are connected to and influence all real economies. Although banks don’t print money themselves, lending accelerates the circulation of funds, effectively creating additional funds, with the total amount being several times the actual cash. The reserve requirement ratio in the US is 0%, 1-2% in developed countries, and over 10% in China. Banks lend based on the profitability of enterprises, forming a screening mechanism that can eliminate the weak and use funds where they are most needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;national-debt&quot;&gt;National Debt&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To develop the economy, such as infrastructure construction, the government needs to spend money. When government revenue is less than expenditure, a fiscal deficit occurs, which is filled by issuing national debt. Now, many countries’ debts account for 50%-100% of GDP, with Japan even at 260%. Government revenue reaching 10% of GDP is already good, so it would take many years of not spending to repay these debts. The consequences of national debt default are severe, leading to the collapse of the financial system and taking decades to recover. Most countries now only repay interest to avoid default, with debt continuously accumulating. Excessive national debt issuance leads to higher national debt interest rates and inflation. Higher interest rates increase the risk of government debt default, and inflation is the number one enemy of the financial system. High national debt can be dragged on, but inflation must be immediately curbed with tightening policies. &lt;strong&gt;Overall, national debt is a means to stimulate the economy, but the red lines of interest rates and inflation must be maintained&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;inflation&quot;&gt;Inflation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inflation is currency devaluation and rising prices. Healthy inflation is a redistribution of wealth, where those who were once wealthy lose wealth if they do nothing, while those who work hard gain new wealth, motivating everyone to work. Inflation stimulates consumption because money devalues if not spent, so people prefer to consume immediately, increasing demand and GDP. Conversely, deflation reduces demand and work motivation. Price changes lead to demand and GDP changes, which are our main concerns. Inflation maintained at 2%-5% is healthy. Uncontrolled money printing by the government causes a vicious cycle: increased total demand → rising prices → increased costs → decreased production → rising prices. Even expected inflation can lead to actual inflation because people expect prices to rise, so they consume in advance, increasing money circulation and causing inflation. Therefore, no matter how bad the situation, the Federal Reserve must appear calm to avoid fueling inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;oil-economy&quot;&gt;Oil Economy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil was first discovered in the US in the early 20th century, and later large reserves were found in the Middle East. Oil is a necessity, and resources are limited, making it a strategic asset. Initially, the Middle East lacked technology, so local countries and organizations controlled the extraction, taking most of the profits, while Middle Eastern countries earned little. Naturally, they were unhappy and fought for nationalization of oil production, eventually gaining sovereignty through force. Middle Eastern countries formed OPEC but secretly engaged in price wars, establishing Saudi Arabia as the leader. Later, the US invented fracking technology to extract oil and gas from shale layers. Although extraction costs are slightly higher at around $30 per barrel, shale oil reserves far exceed traditional oil reserves, with the US having 43.8 billion vs. 2 trillion barrels. “The Stone Age did not end for lack of stone, and the Oil Age will end long before the world runs out of oil.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;silicon-valley-bank-collapse&quot;&gt;Silicon Valley Bank Collapse&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a blessing in disguise. During the pandemic, the government flooded the market with money, increasing liquidity, and many funds went to the high-yield Silicon Valley Bank. They didn’t know how to use these funds quickly, so they bought many long-term bonds for stable returns. However, the Federal Reserve’s rapid interest rate hikes devalued old bonds. Not only bonds, but SVB also bought other assets without hedging against interest rate risks, as the Fed hadn’t raised rates so quickly in over 30 years. Eventually, they suffered heavy losses and had to raise funds to fill the gap. The market saw their losses and need for financing, leading to a bank run. So, &lt;strong&gt;bonds are not without risk&lt;/strong&gt;, especially long-term bonds. &lt;strong&gt;If interest rates rise by 1%, 10-year bonds lose 7%-10% in value&lt;/strong&gt;. Of course, if you can hold on, you’ll be fine in 10 years. What’s the principle? In a very simplified, non-compounding scenario: for example, with a principal of 100 and a 10-year bond at 3% interest, if the interest rate rises to 4% the next day, to sell and stop the loss, you must ensure that the final principal and interest appear to come from a 4% rate. This can only be achieved by lowering the 100 bond’s selling price. Assuming a selling price of x, then 100&lt;em&gt;(1+3%&lt;/em&gt;10)=x&lt;em&gt;(1+4%&lt;/em&gt;10), x=92.86, so a 7.14% loss. Actual bond price calculations are much more complex, and the loss is slightly higher than this method. https://www.buyupside.com/calculators/bondpresentvalue.htm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;duolingo&quot;&gt;Duolingo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The founder invented the graphical CAPTCHA, hailing from a small South American country, aiming to make education more accessible and language learning easier. Surprisingly, they later developed an &lt;strong&gt;English test similar to IELTS and TOEFL&lt;/strong&gt;, recognized by almost all schools, costing only $60 and available online, with video monitoring to prevent cheating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;south-korean-economy&quot;&gt;South Korean Economy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military dictator Park Chung-hee &lt;strong&gt;ruled for about 18 years&lt;/strong&gt;, vigorously developing the South Korean economy by supporting &lt;strong&gt;chaebols&lt;/strong&gt;. After democratization, government-business collusion became severe, with many presidents and chaebol leaders imprisoned but quickly released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;samsung-dynasty&quot;&gt;Samsung Dynasty&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the founding of South Korea to the present, Samsung has been the largest chaebol, &lt;strong&gt;accounting for over 20% of South Korea’s economy&lt;/strong&gt;. The founder started multiple businesses, eventually becoming the leader with Park Chung-hee’s backing. After a succession battle among his three sons, the eldest and second sons were abandoned due to misconduct and harming the group, while the third son, with great foresight, invested in semiconductors. The third-generation leader, during his father’s coma, had to bribe Prime Minister Park Geun-hye’s friend to control the company’s shares, leading to both being imprisoned but quickly released. Interestingly, the Samsung leader doesn’t own many actual Samsung shares but controls the group through many subsidiaries, each holding over 51% of the larger company’s shares, ultimately &lt;strong&gt;controlling Samsung Group with minimal funds&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;south-korean-real-estate-crisis&quot;&gt;South Korean Real Estate Crisis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jeonse&lt;/strong&gt;: borrowing money from banks to rent a house with 60-80% of the house’s value, with no rent paid during the lease, and the rental money fully refunded upon lease termination. It’s a form of leverage, with some people owning over a thousand houses in Seoul, eventually committing suicide due to the economic crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-apple-avoids-taxes&quot;&gt;How Apple Avoids Taxes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before 2017, Apple’s actual tax rate was only 3%. As a multinational company with a global supply chain and factories, each local government should theoretically collect value-added tax, but Apple labels these value-added as &lt;strong&gt;intellectual property usage fees&lt;/strong&gt;. The US taxes globally, but as long as funds don’t enter the US, no tax is due. So, Apple transferred profits to an &lt;strong&gt;Irish&lt;/strong&gt; company, where not only are tax rates low, but there’s also a loophole: if the parent company is not within Ireland’s tax jurisdiction, no tax is due. Later, &lt;strong&gt;Trump introduced a tax cut&lt;/strong&gt;, reducing the rate from 35% to 21%, with overseas capital repatriation taxed at 8%-15.5%, prompting Apple to pay taxes and transfer funds back to the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;credit-suisse&quot;&gt;Credit Suisse&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse once managed up to $1.5 trillion in assets but was ultimately acquired by UBS for just $3.2 billion. Swiss banks are known for their privacy, attracting global clients, including some with illicit funds. Despite Credit Suisse’s large scale and good operational metrics, its pursuit of profit led to neglect in risk management, resulting in occasional scandals that eroded market confidence. When Credit Suisse faced a liquidity crisis, the chairman of its largest shareholder, Saudi National Bank, was asked if they would assist Credit Suisse, and his response of “absolutely not” caused the stock to drop by 20%, sealing its fate. &lt;strong&gt;In the financial system, trust is paramount.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;masayoshi-son&quot;&gt;Masayoshi Son&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He ventured into translation machines, sold gaming consoles, distributed software, and invested in Yahoo, Alibaba, and acquired telecom companies and ARM. He is a high-stakes gambler, willing to invest all his resources, and once raised a $100 billion Vision Fund to invest in tech companies, suffering heavy losses with investments in WeWork and Didi. When the investment scale is too large, it’s inevitable to invest in many beta companies rather than alpha ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;energy-crisis&quot;&gt;Energy Crisis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, European countries shut down nuclear plants and became heavily reliant on Russian natural gas. When Russia invaded Ukraine, Europe sanctioned Russia, reducing gas imports, and Russia cut off gas pipelines, shifting to export more oil to China and India. Countries faced inflation and raised interest rates to curb it, spreading economic tightening globally. The reduction in natural gas led to decreased fertilizer production in Europe, indirectly causing a global food crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;twitter-acquisition&quot;&gt;Twitter Acquisition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the board agrees to an acquisition, it’s straightforward. If not, one could infiltrate the board, forcibly acquire 51% of shares, or offer a higher price to retail shareholders (tender offer). The board can counter with a Poison Pill strategy, allowing all other shareholders to buy new shares at half price if the acquirer’s stake exceeds a certain threshold, effectively diluting the acquirer’s shares, and even distributing free shares to all other shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;short-selling&quot;&gt;Short Selling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, borrow stocks and sell them, then wait for the price to drop and buy back the same number of shares, keeping the difference. The profit is not high; if the stock drops to zero, you can only double your money, and you must pay interest on the borrowed shares. The key risk is unlimited loss; if the stock price increases tenfold, you lose ten times your initial investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;european-debt-crisis&quot;&gt;European Debt Crisis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The formation of the EU reduced business costs among member states, boosting the economy. For convenience, the Euro system was established, and confidence in the Euro led to &lt;strong&gt;overconfidence in economically weaker EU countries&lt;/strong&gt;, lowering their borrowing costs, which spurred economic activity and excessive borrowing. Strong economies bought property in the south, inflating a real estate bubble. When a crisis hit, the bubble burst, and these smaller countries couldn’t repay their debts, leading to defaults. Strong EU countries like Germany had to support weaker ones to maintain Euro credibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;discussing-startups&quot;&gt;Discussing Startups&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spent months developing a product, but there are few users. Not every business is suitable for financing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charges a monthly fee, providing stable cash flow. Its recommendation algorithm not only promotes highly-rated content but also suggests content users may not rate highly but enjoy watching. Competitions improved the &lt;strong&gt;recommendation algorithm&lt;/strong&gt;. Later, it shifted to &lt;strong&gt;content production&lt;/strong&gt;, with original series like “House of Cards” and “Squid Game” attracting many new users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;warren-buffett&quot;&gt;Warren Buffett&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Value investing, buying companies you understand. It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;28-year-old-topples-britains-oldest-bank&quot;&gt;28-Year-Old Topples Britain’s Oldest Bank&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploited a bank loophole by opening an account to transfer losses, gambling increasingly larger amounts. His final bet was a short straddle on the Japanese stock market, which would profit if the market remained stable. However, a 7.3 magnitude earthquake hit Japan, causing a market crash and massive losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;birmingham-bankruptcy&quot;&gt;Birmingham Bankruptcy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In England, finances are more centralized, and local governments have limited fiscal autonomy. During economic downturns, they can go bankrupt due to unforeseen events. In reality, bankruptcy often just means reducing government spending.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Recently, I’ve been watching a lot of videos from Xiao Lin Shuo, and I highly recommend this channel.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every April, countless small flowers bloom, but by May, larger flowers steal the sunlight and rain, causing the smaller ones to wither and die in the shadows. This is what is known as the killers of the flower moon. Nature is indifferent, treating all things as mere straw dogs, and the fate it dictates is as cruel as the natural world. Our so-called civilization often uses a veneer of warmth to mask the brutality of human nature. If we do not revisit histories like the Osage massacres, we may fail to recognize the similarly brutal realities, carefully wrapped yet equally harsh, in our current lives. This film is an epic, meticulously depicting the wild atmosphere of that era and the belated justice. I saw the Osage people’s simplicity and kindness during their internal meetings, where everyone sat together, and the elders, like old fathers, admonished their people. In contrast, Bill’s gang and family, in dark and oppressive rooms, scolded Ernest for his weakness and stupidity. The film portrays the cold cruelty of whites towards Native Americans and the ruthless killing of fellow whites, transcending racial prejudice and being twisted into evil by money and the filth around them. Even the flower of love that bloomed amidst the deceit of money was extinguished and consumed. Mollie, knowing the other party’s ill intentions, still chose to believe in Ernest’s basic decency due to her kind nature. As a viewer, I, too, hoped Leonardo would be a unique and transcendent presence in that cruel world. We were disappointed time and again, yet we continued to hope for the prodigal son to return. But the innocent died, the hired killers were swiftly brought to justice, while the powerful murderers ultimately went unpunished, leaving one unable to let go. The rules of this world are always so frustrating, and even now, they haven’t improved much. I thoroughly enjoyed the brilliant performances of all the actors, the trivial dialogues, and the Southern accents that were challenging to understand, all so rich and fitting, making me feel as if I were there. I have never been interested in Western-themed movies, but I was surprised to find myself enjoying this 3.5-hour-long Western film.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry xml:lang="en"><title type="html">Laozi’s Worldview</title><link href="https://junbo.li/2023/11/01/laozi.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Laozi’s Worldview" /><published>2023-11-01T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-11-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://junbo.li/2023/11/01/laozi</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://junbo.li/2023/11/01/laozi.html">&lt;p&gt;The reference is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/615749738&quot;&gt;Silk Manuscript version of the Tao Te Ching&lt;/a&gt;, but actually, any version will do. The version that allows me to read more meanings is the one that helps me the most. I dare to write my interpretation of Laozi because I really don’t understand what everyone else is saying. Their explanations leave me even more confused, and almost every one of the 5000 characters is controversial. However, my understanding is still very superficial, and I only seek to make sense of it myself and try to be meaningful. Laozi has 80 chapters, and here I have selected 7 chapters that best represent Laozi’s worldview for interpretation. These chapters often coincide with modern physics and culture, which is rare in all philosophical thoughts. Perhaps it is because this universe has a wonderful fractal structure, so the principles are always interconnected. The profound insights of the ancients still have explanatory power in areas they could not have known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-1-epistemology&quot;&gt;Chapter 1: Epistemology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;道可道也，非恒道也。名可名也，非恒名也。无名，万物之始也。有名，万物之母也。故恒无欲也，以观其妙，恒有欲也，以观其所徼。两者同出，异名同谓，玄之又玄，众妙之门。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;literal-translation&quot;&gt;Literal Translation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tao can be spoken of, but those words are not necessarily the eternal truth. Names can be given, but these names will also deviate over time. When chaos is nameless, the Tao has already begun to generate all things; when it becomes tangible and nameable, the Tao is the mother nurturing all things. Therefore, we should maintain an objective heart without desires to observe the subtle essence of the Tao; at the same time, we can also carry some desires and subjective attitudes to see the myriad forms that the Tao evolves into. The essence and phenomena we can describe all come from the same source—the Tao. Even if they have different names, they are essentially the same thing. The Tao is very profound and mysterious, but it is the gateway to understanding all things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;inspiration&quot;&gt;Inspiration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This passage seems to be talking about a kind of epistemology. The Tao represents an objective reality, but the descriptions of real things are not there from the beginning and are not necessarily always correct. These names will change over time. It points out the lag, limitations, and temporality of language and words. At first glance, it seems quite obvious, but using this as the opening may be to let readers put aside their preconceptions and think about the most fundamental things, and to be aware that cognition has its limitations. Here, the difference between desireless and desiring is mentioned, which I think means objective and subjective, and the subtle and the manifest can be understood as essence and phenomena. These concepts are obvious in modern times, but in Laozi’s era, they might have been groundbreaking ideas. Imagine, in those times, people even believed in ghosts and gods. To strip away deeply rooted beliefs and establish such a system of epistemology of the virtual and the real, the objective and the subjective, is quite remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this Tao Te Ching, after such a long time, not only have the words and meanings changed, but people’s understanding of the world has also deepened. So, we should read it flexibly, not be too rigid about the words themselves, but see if the principles behind them are still correct and meaningful. Maybe Laozi was giving himself a way out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-25-defining-tao&quot;&gt;Chapter 25: Defining “Tao”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;有物混成，先天地生。寂呵寥呵，独立而不改，可以为天地母。吾未知其名，字之曰道，吾强为之名曰大。大曰逝，逝曰远，远曰反。道大，天大，地大，王亦大。国中有四大，而王居一焉。人法地，地法天，天法道，道法自然。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;literal-translation-1&quot;&gt;Literal Translation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is something mixed and complete, existing before heaven and earth. It is silent and empty, standing alone and unchanging, thus it can be the mother of heaven and earth. I do not know its name, so I write it as “Tao,” and reluctantly describe it as “Great.” Great can also be described as the eternal passage of time, the eternal passage of time can be deduced to extend infinitely far, extending infinitely far can also be said to be cyclical. The Tao, heaven, earth, and the king all fit these descriptions. They are great, eternal, vast, and cyclical, and the king is also one of them. In a country, there are these four great things, and the king occupies one level. People (the populace and the king as a whole) are born and live under the laws of the earth, the laws of the earth are produced and determined by the laws of heaven or the universe, the laws of heaven are produced and determined by the Tao, and the Tao follows its own laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;inspiration-1&quot;&gt;Inspiration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This passage is Laozi’s direct explanation of the “Tao.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Tao” first encompasses a cosmology. The universe at its inception was a chaotic core, similar to the Big Bang theory, and after the explosion, space and celestial bodies were formed. Laozi encapsulates the entire universe and its laws within the concept of the Tao. The universe is, of course, unimaginably vast, with time spans and distances that are hard to fathom, and it is no wonder that similar laws and substances continuously repeat and extend outward. The Tao is naturally like this. Why is the king (man) also great? Because people reproduce, extending a long history and going to distant places, even if each person is just repeating a similar life of birth, aging, sickness, and death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This passage is very holistic and macro, almost encompassing everything, and provides a meaningful structure to explain such a grand thing. It first vaguely talks about the origin of the Tao—something mixed and complete (after all, science was not developed, but the guess is quite close), then breaks down the attributes of the Tao or “Great,” including time, space, and the repeated appearance of certain units (a bit like what we now call particles, though this is a bit of an over-interpretation, haha), and then describes the interdependence of heaven, earth, and man. This inspires a thought to seek deeper answers. Ultimately, all things follow the Tao, and the Tao is ultimate, self-consistent, and cannot be further questioned. Laozi’s explanation of the universe is very comforting. The universe seems boundless in time and space, but its laws and essence are bounded, self-consistent, and have stable foundations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is the “Tao”? Fu Peirong says it is “the source and destination of all things.” I think the Tao is a kind of holism. The Tao is the sum of all things. The significance of the concept of the Tao is that it expresses a kind of consistency, following the same laws from beginning to end, from macro to micro. The things that make up all things are deeper things, and when you peel away the layers, in the end, it is a very simple thing mixed together. What is the use of understanding the concept of the Tao? We should see things clearly layer by layer and act according to the laws. Of course, there are many other inferences and uses. Overall, it is a cosmology that to some extent alleviates our confusion and bewilderment about the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-40-from-0-to-1&quot;&gt;Chapter 40: From 0 to 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;反也者，道之动也。弱也者，道之用也。天下之物生于有，有生于无。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;literal-translation-2&quot;&gt;Literal Translation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repetition is the movement of the Tao. Weakness is the use of the Tao. All things under heaven are born of tangible things, and tangible things are born of intangible things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;inspiration-2&quot;&gt;Inspiration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microscopic particles, planets, days, and seasons all repeat. Gravity, water flow, habits, and years all act slowly. The Tao is about constantly repeating small actions to create a profound impact. Believe in the power of compounding, start with small things, and persist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything is made up of visible things, like a desk is made of wood, and visible things are made of invisible things, like wood is made of molecules, which ancient people couldn’t see with the naked eye. Although molecules and quarks can now be seen, dark matter and dark energy are still invisible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people interpret Laozi’s “non-being” as “intangible things,” which makes sense. I also translated it this way, otherwise, how could something come from nothing? Of course, matter cannot come from nothing; the material world follows the law of conservation of energy. But “consciousness” and “thought” are very close to something coming from nothing. Although the brain is still made up of those molecules, its special structure produces “concepts,” “feelings,” and “thoughts.” We can understand “concepts” as a kind of “sandbox” shape in the brain made up of molecules. It is a “mapping” of objective things, still based on the original unordered and meaningless molecular distribution, but it becomes an ordered and meaningful “structure.” So what I want to say is that being born of non-being is a paradigm. It can be: tangible born of intangible, organic born of inorganic, order born of disorder, meaning born of meaninglessness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-42-from-1-to-all-things&quot;&gt;Chapter 42: From 1 to All Things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;道生一，一生二，二生三，三生万物。万物负阴而抱阳，中气以为和。人之所恶，唯孤、寡、不谷，而王公以自名也。物或损之而益，益之而损。故人之所教，亦议而教人。故强梁者不得其死，我将以为学父。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;literal-translation-3&quot;&gt;Literal Translation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tao gives birth to one, one gives birth to two, two gives birth to three, and three gives birth to all things. All things have their own deficiencies, so they seek things to complement them. When two things complement each other’s deficiencies, they both survive and form new things together. People dislike being alone, without a partner, or without food, but kings and nobles use these terms to refer to themselves. Things may lose something and become beneficial, or gain something and bring harm. So what others teach, I also teach: “The strong and violent do not die a natural death.” I will take these people as my teachers and use them as negative examples to adjust my actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;inspiration-3&quot;&gt;Inspiration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mainly talks about how the universe develops. The Tao gives birth to one, no doubt, it must start from the Tao. But how does one give birth to two, and how does two give birth to three and then to all things? It is because all things have deficiencies, so they seek things to complement them, thus forming new things, and so on. People fear losing their livelihood, while kings and nobles fear what they call themselves, indicating that their ancestors set the rule that kings and nobles should take solving these problems as their duty, meeting the people’s needs for society to function and develop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everything is better with more. Without deficiencies, there is no motivation. Stay hungry, stay foolish. And not all methods and ideas are suitable for everyone. Teach according to the material. How to grasp the right degree? Look at how others do and the consequences, and learn from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All things carry yin and embrace yang, achieving harmony through balance” is very profound. From protons and electrons attracting each other to marriage and business, it all follows this principle. It explains why tiny particles can form a complex universe! Because of the balance of yin and yang!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-48-non-action&quot;&gt;Chapter 48: Non-Action&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;为学者日益，闻道者日损。损之又损，以至于无为，无为而无不为。圣人之取天下也，恒无事。及其有事也，不足以取天下。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;literal-translation-4&quot;&gt;Literal Translation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A ruler who loves to teach people to do things increases what needs to be done every day. A ruler who understands the Tao decreases what needs to be done every day. Decrease and decrease until there is no need to act. Without acting, everything that needs to be done is done. A ruler who understands the Tao can govern the world by always having nothing to do. When he has too many things to do, he will not have the energy to govern the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;inspiration-4&quot;&gt;Inspiration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, I am not very sure about my translation. Fu Peirong says non-action is acting without a biased heart, which makes sense, teaching us not to have biased desires and ambitions. But here it does not mention desire or heart. In the context, non-action here should really mean not acting, not doing things personally. This is the methodology of the sage’s governance. Leaders should delegate and let their subordinates do things, doing less themselves, and should only consider things three to five years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This applies not only to emperors or leaders but also to everyone. The most important thing to consider every day is how to reduce the things you have to do. First, understand the rules and avoid unnecessary things. Second, automate or delegate many repetitive tasks so that you have the energy to focus on the most important things. This is the so-called subtraction thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Non-action” is the core concept of Taoism. Because it is very paradigmatic, it can encompass many connotations, such as “quiet non-action,” “non-action governance,” “the great Tao is non-action,” and can be applied to values, outlook on life, leadership, and principles of doing things. But it should never be used as an excuse for laziness. Having a heart but not acting will only make you more anxious. Non-action with a heart is a high realm, but those who understand the Tao do not start with non-action. There is a process of daily decrease, which is very important. Young people should try more things. I particularly like Miao Wei’s saying: “People full of desires live with great vigor and happiness.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-51-defining-virtue&quot;&gt;Chapter 51: Defining “Virtue”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;道生之而德畜之，物形之而器成之，是以万物尊道而贵德。道之尊，德之贵也，夫莫之爵，而恒自然也。道生之、畜之、长之、育之、亭之、毒之、养之、覆之。生而弗有也，为而弗恃也，长而弗宰也，此之谓玄德。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;literal-translation-5&quot;&gt;Literal Translation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tao gives birth to them, and virtue nurtures them. Things shape them, and tools complete them. Therefore, all things respect the Tao and value virtue. The respect for the Tao and the value of virtue are not because they are conferred with noble titles but are always natural. The Tao gives birth to them, feeds them, lets them grow, educates them, lets them mature, lets them wither, nourishes them in old age, and finally buries them when they die. It gives birth to all things without possessing them, achieves all things without relying on them, leads all things without dominating them. This is called profound virtue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;inspiration-5&quot;&gt;Inspiration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My translation of “lets them wither, nourishes them, shelters them” is a bit off. No one else translates it this way. But I understand the Tao Te Ching as being quite impartial, not only having a good side but also letting things wither naturally. This sentence, I think, describes the life cycle of all things, from birth to death, as a comprehensive description, paving the way for the definition of virtue. It delineates the scope of virtue’s role, which is within the life cycle of all things, while birth and death are already determined by the Tao. Of course, my understanding has a flaw: why doesn’t it mention virtue’s care for withering and death? But if you ask me to complete this sentence, I can’t write “lets them wither but does not abandon them, ensuring they end well.” This doesn’t sound virtuous. It can only be said that the Tao includes but transcends virtue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it explains what “virtue” is. Fu Peirong says virtue is what all things obtain from the Tao. “Virtue” is a kind of nature and endowment of all things. My understanding is that virtue refers to the qualities on which ecology, individuals, organizations, and even society rely for stability and development. Later chapters mention “profound virtue is deep and far-reaching, contrary to things, yet ultimately in great harmony,” meaning that virtue is very profound because it may come from long historical experience and is not necessarily easy to understand its specific causes and effects. It is also contrary to individual desires, and desires must be moderated to conform to the Tao. In short, virtue is used to tame primitive desires and coordinate the interests of each individual within a group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tao includes virtue because it develops all things without taking credit, and does not arbitrarily interfere with all things. Of course, it cannot take credit or be ennobled; it is an abstract concept, naturally so. As a ruler, if you want society to prosper and develop, you must have virtue, achieving non-possession, non-reliance, and non-abuse of power. As an individual, although you cannot control societal prosperity, you must control your basic desires, even relinquish some personal desires and interests, achieving the “non-contention” mentioned in later chapters, which will ultimately be more beneficial to the individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-38-culture&quot;&gt;Chapter 38: Culture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;上德不德，是以有德。下德不失德，是以无德。上德无为，而无以为也。上仁为之，而无以为也。上义为之，而有以为也。上礼为之，而莫之应也，则攘臂而扔之。故失道而后德，失德而后仁，失仁而后义，失义而后礼。夫礼者，忠信之薄也，而乱之首也。前识者，道之华也，而愚之首也。是以大丈夫居其厚，而不居其薄，居其实，而不居其华。故去彼取此。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;literal-translation-6&quot;&gt;Literal Translation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Superior virtue does not deliberately display virtue, thus it possesses true virtue. Inferior virtue constantly displays virtue, yet lacks true virtue. Superior virtue acts without specific actions, but rather acts without intent. Superior benevolence performs acts of kindness without selfish intent. Superior righteousness performs righteous acts with selfish intent. Superior propriety enforces rituals, and when there is no response, it forces others to comply. Thus, when the great Tao is lost, virtue is esteemed; when virtue is lost, benevolence is esteemed; when benevolence is lost, righteousness is esteemed; when righteousness is lost, propriety is esteemed. Propriety is the manifestation of the lack of loyalty and trust, and the beginning of chaos. Established norms and systems are merely the embellishments of the Tao, and following them is the beginning of folly. Therefore, a great man should be sincere and not superficial, focus on the essence rather than the superficial. Thus, one should discard the latter and embrace the former.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;inspiration-6&quot;&gt;Inspiration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laozi succinctly summarizes the hierarchy of human culture: Tao → Virtue → Benevolence → Righteousness → Propriety, and beyond that, “Law” can be added. When propriety collapses, only harsh laws remain. We have discussed Tao and Virtue before; benevolence refers to kindness and compassion towards others, righteousness to justice and moral duty, and propriety to norms and rituals. These elements are essential in every civilization, but problems that can be addressed with higher-level methods should not be handled with lower-level ones. Lower-level methods are more complex, laborious, and have greater side effects. The quality of an initiative, organization, or civilization is determined by how close its core is to the Tao. A good corporate culture, like the Empathy culture promoted by Satya at Microsoft, elevates to the level of benevolence, reducing inter-departmental conflicts and revitalizing the company. When we add a new rule or regulation, shouldn’t we pause to consider what we might be losing?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The reference is the Silk Manuscript version of the Tao Te Ching, but actually, any version will do.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never finished a day feeling so exhausted. This is the third day of jet lag, starting with a night of shallow sleep. My eyes were heavy almost all day, but I still had to keep them open to take travel photos. I should have taken an afternoon rest, but instead walked almost non-stop along the typical tourist routes. It’s now 10:43 PM, and I should be lying in bed rather than writing notes on my computer. But I want to record a feeling I shared with my family while walking in the evening twilight. Is the life we’re living made up of the subtle emotional baseline, or the intricate details of each small event? Is it the chord progression, or the melody and orchestration?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it was the extreme fatigue of this day that made the emotional baseline so apparent, making the entire day feel unusually “lucid,” clearly aware of both the undertone and details of today’s musical piece. Is it possible that I’ve been dragging my tired body and mind through every ordinary day without realizing it? The anxiety I’ve invested in - is it because things are truly difficult, or am I just climbing mountains of emotional garbage, becoming anxious over any trivial matter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People with deep understanding of music can discern chord progressions, tonality, and dynamics. What about those with deep understanding of life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this feeling I experienced today is just about the relationship between surface appearances and deeper layers. Specifically, all conflicts don’t happen suddenly; contradictions are planted early. What can be properly resolved isn’t the conflict itself, but rather its root causes. And all causes stem from circumstances, and more importantly, the human heart. The human heart is both the most intangible and the most real thing. Intangible because it’s not physical, yet real because it becomes the subject that defines reality. And the more intangible it is, the freer it becomes. The objective world isn’t free, constrained by physical laws, but the human heart is free. When people feel unfree, it’s often not due to objective reasons, but because they don’t recognize the chord progression they’re in, having unconscious limitations. And remarkably, freedom is just a feeling - people have the freedom to make themselves feel free.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>
