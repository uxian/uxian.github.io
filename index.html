        </h3><p>On Monday, November 6th, during the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/new-models-and-developer-products-announced-at-devday">Open AI DevDay</a>, ChatGPT received a major update, with its knowledge base finally updated to April of this year, showing great sincerity. Additionally, the GPT Store was announced, extending an olive branch to creators, inviting them to earn together. Here is my summary of the conference.</p>

        </h3><p>Recently, I’ve been watching a lot of videos from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@xiao_lin_shuo">Xiao Lin Shuo</a>, and I highly recommend this channel. It’s not only full of energy but also packed with valuable information. I force myself to write down my insights and further thoughts to avoid forgetting them after watching, thus wasting time. After watching these videos, my overall feeling is that I’m no longer confused by many phenomena in the economy. I put the takeaways from each episode at the end, and below are some of my own thoughts combined with my previous reflections.</p>

            Laozi&#39;s Worldview
          </a>
        </h3><p>The reference is the <a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/615749738">Silk Manuscript version of the Tao Te Ching</a>, but actually, any version will do. The version that allows me to read more meanings is the one that helps me the most. I dare to write my interpretation of Laozi because I really don’t understand what everyone else is saying. Their explanations leave me even more confused, and almost every one of the 5000 characters is controversial. However, my understanding is still very superficial, and I only seek to make sense of it myself and try to be meaningful. Laozi has 80 chapters, and here I have selected 7 chapters that best represent Laozi’s worldview for interpretation. These chapters often coincide with modern physics and culture, which is rare in all philosophical thoughts. Perhaps it is because this universe has a wonderful fractal structure, so the principles are always interconnected. The profound insights of the ancients still have explanatory power in areas they could not have known.</p>

        </h3><p>There’s nothing more fitting than ending a day spent agonizing over the meaning of life with The Astral Exploration Editorial Department. It feels as though life’s serendipity was meticulously arranged. But of course, it has nothing to do with me. The world moves forward according to its own logic, and I’m simply delighted by this fleeting moment of resonance and emotion.</p>
