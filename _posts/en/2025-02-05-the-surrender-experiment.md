While reading this book, it gave me energy.

After finishing *The Untethered Soul*, I bought *The Surrender Experiment*. But it sat on my bookshelf for several years, because I already knew it would talk about how to surrender to reality and the flow of life, how the author step by step became the head of a publicly listed company—-success coming so easily. I wasn’t very keen on reading a memoir that felt full of superiority and survivor bias. But one day, with nothing else to do, I picked it up, and from the first chapter, I resonated deeply. This was my feeling too:

The universe has existed for 13.8 billion years. Amid the desolate cosmos, a bunch of loose particles were running around, and somehow human beings and consciousness came into being—-so marvelous and intricate. We tend to think that our own consciousness is crucially important, but whether it’s moving a finger or running a company, these aren’t achievements of our slow, feeble consciousness alone. Everything is a product of chance and circumstance. Whether we accept it or not, the universe always flows through us, merging us into its current.

This book differs from *The Untethered Soul* in that it includes many of the author’s personal stories, helping readers better understand meditation, mindfulness, acceptance, spiritual practice, and surrender, and their relevance and meaning in daily life. I really like how the author’s story begins with a single thought: he became aware of that constantly chattering voice in his mind. He had no particular worries; he wasn’t suffering. He just noticed the voice. And so began his lifelong quest-—first trying to eliminate the voice through meditation, then traveling in search of answers, then returning to build a small cabin for solitary living, and apprenticing under a yoga master. Gradually, he discovered that he needed to accept that voice, accept other people’s requests and arrangements, and officially begin what he called “The Surrender Experiment.”

Further on, I couldn’t help thinking: the author must be incredibly talented; his dad works in finance, and he could easily have become an economics professor. It wouldn’t have surprised anyone if he eventually succeeded—-it’s not necessarily about whether he surrendered. Let’s be honest: we often care about whether someone “deserves” their success. To mitigate our own mediocrity, we classify successful people as heirs to wealth, unscrupulous opportunists, or simply lucky. But even that starting point is problematic—-why be so fixated on your own or others’ success? Indeed, that’s just another voice in our head, and there’s no need to identify with it.

The author’s story is actually quite wonderful and aligns with the laws of nature. It slowly takes root and grows; through meditation, he met many people, gradually forming an organization, and started a company. Then, guided by his interests, he began one of the earliest careers as a coder. It’s not a tale of overnight riches. It’s not about sleepless nights of grinding, nor about using every trick in the book. It’s about meditating morning and night, working earnestly, and living each day well.

This book gave me a lot of energy. When needed, I’ll recognize that voice in my mind, accept it, and let it go. When someone offers me suggestions, I’ll listen carefully, accept, and take action. I’ll do what I want to do, and also help people around me as much as I can, because I can accept any outcome—-there’s no need for special expectations or fears. I believe the universal current created me and everything I have, and it will most likely continue creating the future as well. In fact, I am the universe.
